The protagonist, a quirky and somewhat hapless astronaut, gets lost in the vast, empty void of space after a freak accident. Amidst the vast, dark emptiness, the astronaut is aided by a robotic sidekick (who could be malfunctioning or just quirky), and together, they attempt to find their way back to civilization.
