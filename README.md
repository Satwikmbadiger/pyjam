##    Storyline

The game begins with an astronaut’s spacecraft accidentally veering into a mysterious black hole.
Instead of being crushed, they find themselves in an unknown galaxy filled with hostile alien spaceships guarding the way out.
With limited resources and their only hope of survival being their skill behind the controls, the astronaut must shoot down waves of enemy spaceships. 
Each enemy destroyed grants valuable points that fuel their ship’s ability to upgrade its weapons and defenses.
As the levels progress, the enemies become faster, stronger, and deadlier. 
At the climax, the ultimate challenge appears: a massive boss spaceship blocking the black hole exit. With one final battle, the astronaut must prove their skills and set the highest score—or be lost forever in the depths of space

## Storyline

The game follows an astronaut who gets sucked into a black hole and lands on a random planet. Unfortunately, the astronaut’s spaceship is completely destroyed.

Upon waking up, the astronaut explores the planet and stumbles upon a seemingly abandoned spaceship. Inside, the astronaut discovers a non-functional robot. After turning the robot on, it becomes the astronaut's companion, helping to repair the spaceship and escape the planet.

As they venture further, they encounter bizarre void creatures and strange, humorous artifacts, such as a sentient “missing sock” that floats around in space.

Along the way, the astronaut finds a humor chip that activates the robot's humor circuits, turning it into a source of comic relief throughout the journey. 

The astronaut and robot must solve various puzzles to repair different parts of the spaceship. Tasks include organizing space crystals to restore the oxygen system or guessing the right button to activate the spaceship’s controls. 

In addition, they face mini-games like befriending a floating space kitten or guessing the correct control panel button while the robot gives hilariously bad advice.

At the end of the adventure, after overcoming a series of challenging and humorous puzzles, the astronaut manages to repair the spaceship and attempts to escape the planet. However, in a surprising twist, the robot malfunctions, and they end up back in the void again.

The game ends with the robot humorously suggesting they try again—but with a map this time.
