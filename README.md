##    Storyline

The game begins with an astronaut’s spacecraft accidentally veering into a mysterious black hole.
Instead of being crushed, they find themselves in an unknown galaxy filled with hostile alien spaceships guarding the way out.
With limited resources and their only hope of survival being their skill behind the controls, the astronaut must shoot down waves of enemy spaceships. 
Each enemy destroyed grants valuable points that fuel their ship’s ability to upgrade its weapons and defenses.
As the levels progress, the enemies become faster, stronger, and deadlier. 
At the climax, the ultimate challenge appears: a massive boss spaceship blocking the black hole exit. With one final battle, the astronaut must prove their skills and set the highest score—or be lost forever in the depths of space
